<p>
By completing this enrollment application, I agree to the following:
</p>
<p>
Clover is a Medicare Advantage plan and has a contract with the Federal government. I will need to keep my Medicare Parts A and B. I can be in only one Medicare Advantage plan at a time, and I understand that my enrollment in this plan will automatically end my enrollment in another Medicare health plan or prescription drug plan. It is my responsibility to inform you of any prescription drug coverage that I have or may get in the future. Enrollment in this plan is generally for the entire year. Once I enroll, I may leave this plan or make changes only at certain times of the year, when an enrollment period is available (example: October 15-December 7 of every year) or under certain special circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Clover serves a specific service area. If I move out of the area that Clover serves, I need to notify the plan so I can disenroll and find a new plan in my new area. Once I am a member of Clover, I have the right to appeal plan decisions about payment or services if I disagree. I will read the Evidence of Coverage document from Clover when I get it to know which rules I must follow to get coverage with this Medicare Advantage plan. I understand that people with Medicare aren't usually covered under Medicare while out of the country, except for limited coverage near the US border.
</p>
<p>
For HMO plans, I understand that beginning on the date Clover coverage begins, I must get all my health care from Clover, except for emergency or urgently needed services or out-of-area dialysis services. For PPO Plans, I understand that beginning on the date Clover coverage begins, using services in-network can cost less than using services out-of-network, except for emergency or urgently needed services or out-of-area dialysis services. If medically necessary, Clover provides refunds for all covered benefits, even if I get services out of network.
</p>
<p>
Services authorized by Clover and other services contained in my Clover Evidence of Coverage document (also known as a member contract or subscriber agreement) will be covered. Without authorization, NEITHER MEDICARE NOR CLOVER WILL PAY FOR THE SERVICES. I understand that if I am getting assistance from a sales agent, broker, or other individual employed by or contracted with Clover, he/she may be paid based on my enrollment in Clover.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Release of information:</strong>
By joining this Medicare health plan, I acknowledge that Clover will release my information to Medicare and other plans as is necessary for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. I also acknowledge that Clover will release my information including my prescription drug event data to Medicare, who may release it for research and other purposes which follow all applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The information on this enrollment form is correct to the best of my knowledge.
</p>
<p>
I understand that if I intentionally provide false information on this form, I will be disenrolled from the plan. I understand that my signature (or the signature of the person authorized to act on my behalf under the laws of the State where I live) on this application means that I have read and understand the contents of this application. If signed by an authorized individual (as described above), this signature certifies that (1) this person is authorized under State law to complete this enrollment and (2) documentation of this authority is available upon request from Medicare.
